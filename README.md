# Chat Bot

## Project Description

The Chat Bot is a web application that allows users to interact with a pre-made set of responses. The application is built using PHP, Ajax-Javascript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL for the database. 

The Chat Bot is designed to simulate a conversation with a human user. It uses pre-defined responses to answer user queries and provide information on a variety of topics. The application is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, making it a great example of modern web development.

## Main Objective

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Efficiently execute SQL queries in MySQL for storing and retrieving data.
- Design database tables based on the data needed for the application's functionalities.
- Apply a minimalistic web design to the project.

To achieve these objectives, the project was divided into several stages. The first stage involved designing the database schema and creating the necessary tables. The second stage involved building the front-end of the application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The third stage involved building the back-end of the application using PHP and MySQL.

## What I've Learned

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:

- Learned how to use white card characters such as (%) to efficiently search for records in the database.
- Gained experience in modern web development using MySQL and related technologies.
- Learned how to build a responsive and user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Gained experience in building a back-end using PHP and MySQL.
- Use AWS RDS MySQL database to access the database table.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development using MySQL and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
