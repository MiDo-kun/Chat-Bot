# Chat Bot

The Chat Bot is a web application that allows users to interact with a pre-made set of responses. The application is built using PHP, Ajax-Javascript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL for the database. 

The Chat Bot is designed to simulate a conversation with a human user. It uses pre-defined responses to answer user queries and provide information on a variety of topics. The application is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, making it a great example of modern web development.
